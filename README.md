#Goal Tracker

This simple web application allows you to add and track your goals. Whenever you try to add a new goal, it checks for duplicates in the existing list and alerts you if there's a duplicate.

##Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open index.html in your web browser.

##How It Works

Loop through the existing list of goals (arrayline).
Check if the input goal (goalInput) is already present in the list.
If a duplicate is found, display an alert.
If no duplicate is found, create a new list item (newGoal), append it to the list, and clear the input field.
